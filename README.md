# DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-HID-PID-COMMUNICATION

To make the FFB pedal compatible with classical FFB wheel signals and thus make it fully controlable via racing games, I needed to understand the HID PID protocol. Here is an app to controll my steering wheel via HID PID messages. 

The next steps will be to make the FFB pedal accept the HID PID messages.
